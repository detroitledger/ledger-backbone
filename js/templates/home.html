    <p>That's how much we've recorded in grants to date. We've got <strong><%= stats.num_grants %></strong> grants from <strong><%= stats.num_orgs %></strong> organizations.</p>
    <p>
      We have been collecting information about grants made in Detroit. We started this project with a desire to explore the data and put it in one place, making it more available for us and others to glean insight into philanthropic impact in Detroit.

    <h2 class="callout">How we got here</h2>
    <p>For all of the good work that organizations are doing in Detroit, much of it happens sight unseen. It’s difficult for nonprofits, residents, and scholars to see the bigger picture of the funding system they inhabit. Some funders do a great job of listing their grants online, but many don’t. Some non-profit organizations post annual reports online, but the digital divide can make this task difficult and expensive.</p>

    <p>Much of the data here was scoured from “forms 990” - tax filings for 501(c) tax exempt organizations. This leaves out some of the smaller organizations as well as the immense number of nonprofits that don’t have tax exempt status, like public charter schools and smaller foundations that fly under the radar. We've made an attempt to scour public and private records to find those details.

    <h2 class="callout">So many grants!</h2>
    <p>We've organized 1,942 grants from 2009-2013. The records range from <a href="#/grants/1342">a $42 token of support given to a university department</a> to <a href="#/grants/1799">$47 million of federal HUD funding</a>.</p>

    <p>To give a sense of the general scale of grant amounts, the graph below shows the distribution of all grants:</p>
    <!-- city of detroit: 22029
         HUD: 22009 -->
    <div class="d3" data-type="all_grants" data-options-scale="log"></div>
    <p>The red dot is the median, and white dots are outliers. The lines above and below the median red dot represent most grants on either side of the median.</p>

    <h2 class="callout">Insight</h2>
    <p>To get an idea of the potential research and insight one can glean from the detail in our dataset, let's look at micro-funding. <a href="#/organizations/175">Detroit Soup</a> is one of a few examples of granting organizations that deliver small (100-1,000 dollar) grants. This sector is off the radar of larger grant databases. Look how SOUP's grant giving has grown since its humble beginnings:</p>

    <p>The red dot is the median, and white dots are outliers. The lines above and below the median red dot represent most grants on either side of the median.</p>
    <p>By continuing to collect data about small-scale grant givers, we hope to shed light on this growing sector.</p>

    <h2 class="callout">Most connected funders</h2>

    <p>In the network of philanthropy, the most connected funders are foundations that reach out to the most organizations. These are often the funders who also have the highest number of individual grants each year &mdash; but not necessarily the most money granted. The least connected funders are the foundations that funnel their funds to a small set of organizations, often the same ones year after year.</p>

      <li><a href="#/organizations/454">Skillman Foundation</a></li>
